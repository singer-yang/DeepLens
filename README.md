**DeepLens** is a differentiable optical lens simulator. It is developed for (1) differentiable optical design, (2) end-to-end optics-vision co-design, and (3) photorealistic image simulation. DeepLens helps researchers build custom differentiable optical systems and computational imaging pipelines with minimal effort.

## Mission

1. Next-generation **optical design software** enhanced by differentiable optimization.
2. Next-generation **computational cameras** integrating optical encoding with deep learning decoding.

## Features

1. **Differentiable Optics.** DeepLens leverages gradient backpropagation and differentiable optimization, demonstrating outstanding optimization power compared to classical optical design.
2. **Automated Lens Design.** Enables automated lens design using curriculum learning, optical regularization losses, and GPU acceleration.
3. **Hybrid Refractive-Diffractive Optics.** Supports accurate simulation and optimization of hybrid refractive-diffractive lenses (e.g., DOEs, metasurfaces).
4. **Accurate Image Simulation.** Delivers photorealistic, spatially-varying image simulations, verified against commercial software and real-world experiments.
5. **Optics-Vision Co-Design.** Supports end-to-end differentiability from optics, sensor, and ISP to vision algorithms, enabling comprehensive optics-vision co-design.

Additional features (available via collaboration):

1. **Polarization Ray Tracing.** Provides polarization ray tracing and differentiable optimization of coating films.
2. **Non-Sequential Ray Tracing.** Includes a differentiable non-sequential ray tracing model for stray light analysis and optimization.
3. **Kernel Acceleration.** Achieves >10x speedup and >90% GPU memory reduction with custom GPU kernels across NVIDIA and AMD platforms.
4. **Distributed Optimization.** Supports distributed simulation and optimization for billions of rays and high-resolution (>100k x 100k) diffractive computations.
