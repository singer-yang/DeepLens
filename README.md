## What is DeepLens

DeepLens aims to combine **deep learning** and **optical design** for:

1. More powerful **optical design algorithms** enhanced by deep learning.
2. Next-generation **computational cameras** integrating optical encoding with deep learning decoding.

## Key Features

DeepLens differs from other optical software in:

1. **Differentiable** design with outstanding optimization capabilities.
2. **Open-source** optical simulator (ray-tracing, wave optics) with validated accuracy.
3. **End-to-end imaging** with sensor statistics and image signal processing (ISP).
4. **Fast computation** with core functions customized for GPU parallelization.

Additional features:

1. **Physical optics** simulations including polarization tracing and film design.
2. **Complex optical systems** including non-sequential and non-coaxial optics.
3. **Neural representations** for efficient implicit optical models.
4. **Faster and better efficience** through GPU kernel customization.
5. **Large-scale** optimization with multi-machine distribution.

## Applications
