# DeepLens Community Code of Conduct

## Introduction

- Diversity and inclusion make our community strong. We encourage participation from the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible and want to be very clear about where we stand.
- Our goal is to maintain a safe, helpful and friendly community for everyone, regardless of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other defining characteristic.
- This code and related procedures apply to unacceptable behavior occurring in all community venues, including our GitHub repository, Slack/WeChat groups, and other forums. This also includes behavior outside the scope of community activities — online and in-person— as well as in all one-on-one communications, and anywhere such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

## Expected Behavior

### Be Respectful and Collaborative

DeepLens brings together people from various backgrounds, including optics, physics, computer science, and engineering. We expect members to be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences. Communicate politely and constructively. Please help us build a respectful, blame-free, and inclusive community.

### Be Considerate

Many DeepLens contributors are researchers, students, or professionals with other primary commitments. Please be considerate of others who may have different schedules and priorities. When submitting contributions like pull requests, aim for clarity and conciseness to facilitate efficient review.

### Be Pragmatic and Focused

Our goal is to solve practical problems in optical design and computational imaging. Simple, readable, and maintainable solutions are highly valued. We encourage a focus on quality over quantity. Behaving professionally and paying attention to detail helps build trust and a strong reputation within the community.

## Unacceptable Behavior
