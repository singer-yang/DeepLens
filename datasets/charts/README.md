### Image Quality (IQ) Evaluation

In the realm of computer science, image quality evaluation is commonly conducted using pixel-level metrics, such as PSNR, and perceptual metrics, like LPIPS. These metrics serve as crucial tools for quantifying image fidelity; however, the landscape of image quality assessment encompasses a broader array of evaluation metrics. This includes both non-subjective measures, which rely on objective calculations, and subjective assessments, which incorporate human judgment to gauge visual appeal and perception.
