**Differentiable optics** was developed by the KAUST Computational Imaging Group (https://vccimaging.org/). The first version of differentiable ray tracer was implemented by [Dr. Congli Wang](https://congliwang.github.io/) on Mitsuba2 in the following paper:

```bibtex
@article{sun2021end,
  title={End-to-end complex lens design with differentiable ray tracing},
  author={Sun, Qilin and Wang, Congli and Qiang, Fu and Xiong, Dun and Wolfgang, Heidrich},
  journal={ACM Trans. Graph},
  volume={40},
  number={4},
  pages={1--13},
  year={2021}
}
```

Later, Dr. Congli Wang implemented the first PyTorch version of differentiable ray tracer (**dO**) in the following paper:

```bibtex
@article{wang2022differentiable,
  title={do: A differentiable engine for deep lens design of computational imaging systems},
  author={Wang, Congli and Chen, Ni and Heidrich, Wolfgang},
  journal={IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging},
  volume={8},
  pages={905--916},

}
```

Currently, [Xinge Yang](https://singer-yang.github.io/) is building and maintaining **DeepLens**. The automated lens design work demonstrates the outstanding capability of differentiable optics compared to classical optical design in the following paper:

```bibtex
@article{yang2024curriculum,
  title={Curriculum learning for ab initio deep learned refractive optics},
  author={Yang, Xinge and Fu, Qiang and Heidrich, Wolfgang},
  journal={Nature communications},
  volume={15},
  number={1},
  pages={6572},
  year={2024},
  publisher={Nature Publishing Group UK London}
}
```

A novel differentiable ray-wave model is introduced for simulating and optimizing hybrid refractive-diffractive lenses in the following paper:
